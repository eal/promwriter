* Promwriter

#+begin_quote
A stupid simple command line Prometheus remote writer
#+end_quote

This is a simple tool to write metrics to Prometheus using remote
write.  It was created to debug Prometheus, but could possibly also be
used to send metrics from cron jobs running shell scripts.

It has almost no features, and probably never will.

To run:

#+begin_src sh
promwriter --data '{"value":123.4,"labels":{"__name__":"dummy_metric","job":"foobar123"}}' --url http://localhost:9090/api/v1/write  
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
  docker run -ti -e METRIC_DATA='{"value":123.4,"labels":{"__name__":"dummy_metric","job":"foobar123"}}' -e REMOTE_WRITE_URL=http://1.2.3.4:9090/api/v1/write datatyp/promwriter:v0.0.1
#+end_src

It also accepts --interval or SEND_INTERVAL to send metrics every n
seconds.

Auth is not supported
